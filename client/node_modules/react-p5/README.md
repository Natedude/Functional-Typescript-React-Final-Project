    ```bash
    npm i --save react-p5
    ```

-   yarn

    ```

## Usage
For Tips and [Advanced Usage](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/integrating-p5-sketches-into-your-react-app-de44a8c74e91) you can read this [Blog Post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/integrating-p5-sketches-into-your-react-app-de44a8c74e91)

#### JavaScript

```js
import React from "react";
import Sketch from "react-p5";

	let x = 50;
	let y = 50;
export default (props) => {
	const setup = (p5, canvasParentRef) => {
		// use parent to render the canvas in this ref
		// (without that p5 will render the canvas outside of your component)
		p5.createCanvas(500, 500).parent(canvasParentRef);
	};

	const draw = (p5) => {
		p5.background(0);
		p5.ellipse(x, y, 70, 70);
		// NOTE: Do not use setState in the draw function or in functions that are executed
		// in the draw function...
		// please use normal variables or class properties for these purposes
		x++;
	};

	return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw} />;
};
```

#### Typescript

```typescript
import React from "react";
import Sketch from "react-p5";
import p5Types from "p5"; //Import this for typechecking and intellisense

interface ComponentProps {
	//Your component props
}

const YourComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = (props: ComponentProps) => {
	let x = 50;
	const y = 50;

	//See annotations in JS for more information
	const setup = (p5: p5Types, canvasParentRef: Element) => {
		p5.createCanvas(500, 500).parent(canvasParentRef);
	};

	const draw = (p5: p5Types) => {
		p5.background(0);
		p5.ellipse(x, y, 70, 70);
		x++;
	};

	return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw} />;
};
```

#### Tips
- If you need to get the `browser event object` inside your p5 methods like `mouseClicked` or others you can do it by accessing the second arg.
```js
mouseClicked(_p5, event) {
  console.log(event)
}
```

- Events that are accessed using props are always attached to `window`. 
That means that events are triggered throughout the whole page ([see the p5 docs for reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element/mousePressed)).  

If you would like to attach events only to canvas see the example below.
As an example limiting click events to the canvas:
```javascript
const setup = (p5, canvasParentRef) => {
      cnv = p5.createCanvas(width, height).parent(canvasParentRef)
      cnv.mousePressed((event) => {
        console.log("Clicked on the canvas. Event:", event)
      })
    }
```
